## Key Features

* We implemented an end-
to-end client-server chat application, first with our
own wire protocol and later with gRPC. 
* As currently implemented, our chat
application supports the following:
- Account creation, login, deletion, and deactiva-
tion.
- Sending messages between accounts, even when
some accounts are offline.
- Listing or filtering all users who have created
accounts.
* The source code for our chat application can be
found here. The gRPC implementation is in grpcApp. 
* You can also find our project writeup at template.pdf
* All setup and usage functionality will be for the non-gRPC version of our app.
